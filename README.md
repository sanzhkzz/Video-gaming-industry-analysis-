# **Objectives**




Since I was interested in the video game industry since childhood, I decided to choose a dataset related to the history and sale of games. This dataset has 11 columns, where we release statistics on sales of games (in millions of dollars) and platforms that have been released since 1980. 




In this dataset, three main countries that release games were identified, which are Japan, North America and Europe.     So , Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, KONAMI, etc. are located in these countries.


1.I want to show you how history of videogames was formed by its production and what games were actual from 1980 to 2020 . 

2.What is the distribution of countries' sales and what type of correlation do dataset's columns do have between each other .

3.Show what countries' preferences in terms of genre of games in different regions
